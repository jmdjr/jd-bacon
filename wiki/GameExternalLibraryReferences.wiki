#summary Describes the external libraries planned to be used in the code.

= Introduction =
Since XNA is such a core library, implementing everything necessary for any good game across multiple platforms, it can't account for all the important aspects of a game.  This is where external libraries come in.  Here, I will include links to and details about the External libraries used to assist in developing our game.

= Details =
First off, I would like to thank Nelxon and his XNA Developer Survival Kit 2 found [http://nelxon.com/resources/xdsk2/ here].  Most if not all of these external libraries are found at that link.
So far, here are the external libraries I plan on using (as of 3/3/2012)

XNAnimation - Chartacter modeling support, animation and texture mapping.

ScreenManager - Used to manage scene transistions (title scene, game scene, etc)

EasyXnaAudioComponent - simple and small class to assist managing the songs and sound effects in our game.
