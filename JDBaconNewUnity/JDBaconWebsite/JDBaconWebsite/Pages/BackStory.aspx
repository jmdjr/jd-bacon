In the not too distant future, our planet has been unified by the vegan movement HAM (Humans Against eating Meat).<br />
Eating meat has been outlawed, and Earth is now a utopia of healthy living. Animals and humans began to coexist.  <br />
Many animals began to grow intelligence over the decades because of this coexistence.  <br />
The pigs were the first to gain this heightened intelligence.  <br />
They began to form a culture of their own.  <br />
They soon had their own country and settlements all around the world.  <br />
However the peace did not last long. One pig wanted to rule the world.<br />
The evil Dr. Swine is a mad genetic scientist capable creating an army of monsters.  <br />
His takeover started small at first; members of the vegan movement began to disappear.  <br />
Soon afterwards the zombies began to bring anarchy within the streets of the HAM capital named Topia.  <br />
At this point nobody knew what was going on.  <br />
The leader of the HAM movement Kali Flower and the champion of the pigs JD began a combined effort to stop the zombie threat and take down whoever was responsible for it.  <br />
Little did they know that this threat is just the beginning.<br />
Dr. Swine had enough of JD and Kali Flower’s meddling.  <br />
He decided to turn them against each other.  <br />
The evil doctor sent his minions to capture Kali Flower for experimentation.  <br />
With the HAM leader under his control he was now able to begin the second phase of his plan; kill JD.<br />
<br />
JD would never have expected the fight to enter his home; <br />
especially not in the form of one of his allies. Kali Flower and her fellow zombie lackeys overran the Topian pig embassy; <br />
slaughtering everybody within.  <br />
<br />
The pig scientists went hard at work to find a way to bring life back into this cooked piece of meat.  <br />
One failure after another began to discourage the pigs, but the pigs needed their champion to fight this unknown evil.  <br />
JD is now hungry for revenge and will not stop until he puts those who killed his family and friends to justice.<br />
