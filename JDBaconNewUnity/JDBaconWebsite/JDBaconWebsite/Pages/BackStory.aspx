In the not too distant future, our planet has been unified by the vegan movement HAM (Humans Against eating Meat).  
Eating meat has been outlawed, and Earth is now a utopia of healthy living. Animals and humans began to coexist.  
Many animals began to grow intelligence over the decades because of this coexistence.  
The pigs were the first to gain this heightened intelligence.  
They began to form a culture of their own.  
They soon had their own country and settlements all around the world.  
However the peace did not last long. One pig wanted to rule the world.
The evil Dr. Swine is a mad genetic scientist capable creating an army of monsters.  
His takeover started small at first; members of the vegan movement began to disappear.  
Soon afterwards the zombies began to bring anarchy within the streets of the HAM capital named Topia.  
At this point nobody knew what was going on.  
The leader of the HAM movement Kali Flower and the champion of the pigs JD began a combined effort to stop the zombie threat and take down whoever was responsible for it.  
Little did they know that this threat is just the beginning.
Dr. Swine had enough of JD and Kali Flower’s meddling.  
He decided to turn them against each other.  
The evil doctor sent his minions to capture Kali Flower for experimentation.  
With the HAM leader under his control he was now able to begin the second phase of his plan; kill JD.

JD would never have expected the fight to enter his home; 
especially not in the form of one of his allies. Kali Flower and her fellow zombie lackeys overran the Topian pig embassy; 
slaughtering everybody within.  

The pig scientists went hard at work to find a way to bring life back into this cooked piece of meat.  
One failure after another began to discourage the pigs, but the pigs needed their champion to fight this unknown evil.  
JD is now hungry for revenge and will not stop until he puts those who killed his family and friends to justice.
